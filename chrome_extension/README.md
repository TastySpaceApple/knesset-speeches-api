For some reason, despite the Knesset working for the public (and thus discussions should be in the public domain and openly available), they are protected by Reblaze to prevent scraping (In my opinion, they should have actually created an open API!).

And so this chrome extension scrapes the dam glitchy app and sends the data to a server that HAS an open api.
